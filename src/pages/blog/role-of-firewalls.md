# The Role of Firewalls in Small Business Security

Firewalls are a fundamental component of network security. Here's why they're crucial:

1. **Traffic Monitoring**: Firewalls monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.

2. **Access Control**: They control which traffic is allowed or blocked based on predefined security rules.

3. **Threat Prevention**: Modern firewalls can detect and prevent various types of cyber attacks.

4. **VPN Support**: Many firewalls support Virtual Private Networks for secure remote access.

5. **Logging and Reporting**: Firewalls provide valuable data for security analysis and compliance.
