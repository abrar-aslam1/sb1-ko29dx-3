# Understanding and Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a crucial security measure for small businesses. Here's what you need to know:

1. **What is MFA?**: MFA requires two or more verification factors to gain access to an account.

2. **Types of Factors**:
   - Something you know (password)
   - Something you have (phone or security key)
   - Something you are (biometrics)

3. **Benefits**: MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.

4. **Implementation**: Start with critical accounts and gradually roll out to all systems.

5. **User Education**: Train employees on the importance of MFA and how to use it correctly.

Remember, MFA is a powerful tool in your security arsenal. Implement it wisely to strengthen your overall security posture.
