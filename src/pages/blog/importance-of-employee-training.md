# The Importance of Employee Training in Security

Your employees are your first line of defense against cyber threats. Here's why training is crucial:

1. **Threat Recognition**: Employees learn to identify potential security risks, such as phishing emails or suspicious links.

2. **Policy Compliance**: Training ensures staff understand and follow your company's security policies and procedures.

3. **Password Management**: Teach best practices for creating and managing strong, unique passwords.

4. **Data Handling**: Educate on proper handling of sensitive information to prevent data breaches.

5. **Incident Reporting**: Employees learn how to report security incidents promptly and correctly.
