# Physical Security for Small Businesses

Physical security is often overlooked but is crucial for protecting your business assets. Here's how to enhance your physical security:

1. **Access Control**: Implement key card systems or biometric access for sensitive areas.

2. **Surveillance**: Install and maintain security cameras in key locations.

3. **Secure Equipment**: Lock down valuable equipment and secure server rooms.

4. **Visitor Management**: Implement a visitor management system to track who enters your premises.

5. **Employee Training**: Educate employees on physical security protocols. Learn more about [Security Awareness Training](/pillars/physical-security/security-awareness-training).

Remember, physical security complements your digital security measures. A comprehensive approach that addresses both physical and cyber threats is key to protecting your small business.
