# Business Continuity Planning for Small Businesses

A solid business continuity plan ensures your business can continue operating during and after a disaster. Here's what to include:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential threats and their impact on your business operations.

2. **Critical Functions**: Determine which business functions are essential and prioritize their recovery.

3. **Recovery Strategies**: Develop strategies for restoring critical functions quickly.

4. **Resource Planning**: Identify the resources needed to implement your recovery strategies.

5. **Testing and Maintenance**: Regularly test and update your business continuity plan.
