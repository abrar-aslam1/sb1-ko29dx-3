# Phishing Prevention for Small Businesses

Phishing remains one of the most common cyber threats. Here's how to protect your business:

1. **Email Filters**: Implement strong email filtering solutions to catch potential phishing attempts.

2. **Employee Education**: Train employees to recognize and report phishing attempts.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement MFA to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

4. **Regular Testing**: Conduct phishing simulations to test employee awareness.

5. **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure all systems and software are up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
