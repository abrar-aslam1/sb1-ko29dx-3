# Data Protection for Small Businesses

Protecting your business data is crucial in today's digital landscape. Here's how to safeguard your valuable information:

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

2. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege.

3. **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular, secure backups of all critical data. Learn more about [Data Backup Strategies](/pillars/data-protection/backup-strategies).

4. **Data Classification**: Categorize data based on sensitivity and apply appropriate protection measures.

5. **Employee Training**: Educate employees on data handling best practices and security policies.
