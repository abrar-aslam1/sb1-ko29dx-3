# Cloud Security for Small Businesses

As more businesses move their operations to the cloud, ensuring the security of your cloud infrastructure becomes crucial. Here's how to enhance your cloud security:

1. **Access Management**: Implement strong Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data both in transit and at rest in the cloud.

3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your cloud infrastructure.

4. **Compliance**: Ensure your cloud setup complies with relevant industry standards and regulations.

5. **Vendor Security**: Evaluate the security measures of your cloud service providers.

For more on protecting your data, both on-premises and in the cloud, check out our [Data Protection](/pillars/data-protection) pillar.

Remember, cloud security is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud provider. Stay informed about your provider's security features and how to use them effectively.
