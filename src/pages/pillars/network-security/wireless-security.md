# Wireless Security for Small Businesses

Wireless networks are convenient but can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. Here are key steps to enhance your wireless security:

1. **Use Strong Encryption**: Implement WPA3 or WPA2 encryption for your wireless networks.

2. **Change Default Settings**: Modify default router passwords and SSID names.

3. **Enable Network Segmentation**: Separate guest networks from your main business network.

4. **Implement Strong Authentication**: Use strong passwords and consider implementing 802.1X authentication.

5. **Regular Updates**: Keep your wireless access points and routers updated with the latest firmware.
