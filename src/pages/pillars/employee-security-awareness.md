# Employee Security Awareness for Small Businesses

Your employees are your first line of defense against security threats. Here's how to build a security-aware culture:

1. **Regular Training**: Conduct ongoing security awareness training for all employees.

2. **Phishing Simulations**: Run regular phishing simulations to test and educate employees.

3. **Clear Policies**: Develop and communicate clear security policies and procedures.

4. **Incident Reporting**: Establish an easy-to-use system for reporting security incidents.

5. **Lead by Example**: Ensure management follows and promotes security best practices.

Remember, creating a security-aware culture is an ongoing process. Regularly update your training programs to address new and evolving threats.
